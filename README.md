# QuickSplitter

QuickSplitter is an Android app for quick access to split-screen mode.

Android's split screen feature is useful for using two apps at the
same time.  In Android 9 Pie, however, the new gesture navigation
system makes it harder to enter split-screen mode.

This app create a quick settings tile for quick access to split-screen
mode.  You can toggle split-screen mode quickly by tapping the tile.

Android 7.0 Nougat or later are supported.
